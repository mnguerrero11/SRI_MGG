## Description

SolrJ is a Java client library that provides a convenient way to interact with Apache Solr, an open-source search platform built on Apache Lucene. SolrJ is used for connecting to and interacting with Solr from Java applications. It simplifies the process of sending queries to Solr, indexing documents, and managing various aspects of Solr.

- Querying: SolrJ allows you to construct and send queries to Solr, enabling full-text search, faceted search, and filtering based on various criteria.

- Indexing: You can use SolrJ to add, update, or delete documents in the Solr index. This is useful for applications that need to maintain and search a collection of documents or data.
